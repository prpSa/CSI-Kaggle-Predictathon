CSI Inter College Data Science and ML Competition 

# CSI RAIT'S Kaggle Competition
The ultimate purpose of every educational institution is to provide students with the finest educational experience and information possible. Identifying pupils who require further assistance and taking necessary measures to improve their performance is critical to reaching that aim.

# Background
Education is the backbone and a critical aspect in a country's progress. The research on the education system and the performance of students' learning is critical for educational institutions and the government to make quality education decisions. According to statistics data, a student's education is primarily determined by his family background, personal profile, and hobbies. Surprisingly, some elements such as alcohol usage, outing (going outside with friends), and romance have an affect on his schooling and results. The hierarchical cluster analysis predicts the reason of student pass and failure by several characteristics such as family size, alcoholic intake on working days and weekends, address (rural/urban), sex (male/female), and student regularity.

# Aim of The Competition
To predict the final Grade (G3) of each student by the given dataset about his/her life and time spent.
